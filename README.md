# AdobeAMDFix
 Based on @naveenkrdy's AdobeAMDFix with the intent to resolve Photoshop's inability to open files without crashing.

This script accomplishes 2 additional tasks:

First, it incorporates creating the launch agent, credits to the original author will be given if requested (I'm so sorry, I don't recall where I found that tid bit, just PM me or comment and I will update).
Second, it resolves an issue pertaining to Photoshop crashing upon attempting to open any file, or open a file with Photoshop.

1: Download "Adobe 2021 AMD Patch.command"
2: Make it executable by opening terminal, writing "sudo chmod +x " (don't write the double quotes into terminal, and make sure there's a trailing space at the end.)
3: Drag the "Adobe 2021 AMD Patch.command" file into terminal and then hit enter. You'll be prompted to enter your passsword.
4: Double click to run the "Adobe 2021 AMD Patch.command" file and then restart once it's finished.

Please note that I am not dedicated to making a perfect solution here, I just have been fighting with this for a week and rely on PS professionally.

It also might be worth noting that I rolled my version of photoshop back to v22.1.1, from the latest, but I have a hunch that this would work on the latest release as well.
